2.  This program uses an API, described in ixpando.h, that abstracts access to 
    the Ixpando board.  It was meant to be built and run on a Raspberry Pi;
    no other platforms have been tested.  See main.c and ixpando.h for details
    on how this all works.

3.  This program relies on the wiringPi library available from wiringpi.com.
    Their web site describes how to download, build, and install the library.

      rpi pin 3 = SDA
      rpi pin 4 = +5v
